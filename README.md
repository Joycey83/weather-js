# Weather App

The Weather Application was created for the Shecodes Plus Project

## Introduction

A simple weather application that displays the current weather and daily forecasts based on geolocation or search.

My approach for designing this weather application was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The applicaion is also accessible through a range of different devices.

- Background images changes depending on the weather temperature for example if they city/country the user selected is < 0 a snowing background image will be shown. If the temperature is > 19 a sunny background image will be shown etc.

# Running Locally

## Live server

1.You will need node.js and npm. You should probably install this globally.

2.run the following command in your terminal:

npm install -g live-server

3.In your project directory issue the command live-server

4.This will automatically launch the default browser. When you make a change to any file, the browser will reload the page - unless it was a CSS file in which case the changes are applied without a reload.

# Credit

- Animated weather Icons was taken from [Meteocons](https://bas.dev/work/meteocons) designed by [Basmilius](https://bas.dev/)
