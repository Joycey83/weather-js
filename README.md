# Weather App

The Weather Application was created for the Shecodes Plus Project

## Introduction

A simple weather application that displays the current weather and daily forecasts based on geolocation or search.

My approach for designing this weather application was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The applicaion is also accessible through a range of different devices.
